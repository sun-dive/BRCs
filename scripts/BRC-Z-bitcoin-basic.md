# BRC-Z: Bitcoin Script to and from Bitcoin BASIC — a compiler and a decompiler

sun-dive (https://github.com/sun-dive)

## Abstract

Bitcoin Script is a stack machine with no names, no types and no structure a reader can hold. It is also,
almost exactly, the machine that sits underneath every infix expression evaluator written for an 8-bit
microcomputer: `v = v + f/m - v*d` becomes the same sequence of stack operations in either.

This standard defines **Bitcoin BASIC**, a BASIC dialect in one-to-one correspondence with the Script opcode
set, and the two translations between them — a **compiler** that emits Script from the dialect, and a
**decompiler** that renders a deployed locking script back into it. The dialect adds no runtime: every
construct either emits opcodes or is resolved at compile time.

The decompiler is the half with no precedent. A compiler reports what an author meant; a decompiler reports
what the bytes say — including bytes the reader did not write, fetched from the chain, belonging to somebody
else.

**Both directions run in a browser, with nothing to install:**

Paste a locking script and read it back as a program, or write the dialect and compile it. The same
implementation is also published on chain, which is for permanence and verification rather than for use.

## Motivation

A covenant cannot be amended. Its constants are permanent, its branches are permanent, and the transaction
that publishes it is the last moment at which any of it can change. Yet a covenant of useful size cannot be
checked by eye: a working one is a few thousand opcodes of stack manipulation, a single significant constant
is a two-byte push somewhere inside it, and one edit moves every offset and depth that follows. What gets
verified in practice is a mental model of the script rather than the script — and the model is invalidated by
the very change it was meant to check.

The consequence is that errors are discovered after publication and funding, when nothing can be altered.

Both halves of the answer are needed, and only one of them is conventional:

- **Compiling** removes a class of defect at the source. Branch arms that disagree about stack depth, a
  value left on the altstack in one arm only, a depth counted by hand — none of these are expressible in a
  higher-level language, so a compiler cannot emit them.
- **Decompiling** is what makes verification possible at all, and it applies to scripts nobody in possession
  of the tool wrote. It is the only route by which a third party can review a covenant before trusting value
  to it.

### Relationship to BRC-15 and BRC-106

This standard sits above the existing representations rather than competing with them.

BRC-15 defines an assembly language for Script, and BRC-106 standardises deterministic translation of Script
to and from ASM. Both operate at **one token per opcode**: they are lossless, they preserve the opcode
sequence exactly, and they recover no structure. `OP_ADD` states that an addition occurs; it does not state
that a line reads `v = v + f/m - v*d`, nor which bytes of a script are its mutable state.

Bitcoin BASIC operates on **sequences** of opcodes, and recovers structure: infix expressions, conditional
blocks, named state fields, and loop bodies where the loop survives in the script. It is therefore lossy in
*spelling* and exact in *behaviour* — a decompiled program recompiles to a script with identical semantics,
and frequently to identical bytes.

The layers compose: Bitcoin BASIC to Script, and Script to ASM under BRC-15 or BRC-106.

### Scope

Defines the correspondence between the dialect and the opcode set, the obligations of a conforming compiler,
the obligations of a conforming decompiler, and the round trip between them.

Does not define a covenant's funding, its authorisation, or where its state lives — those are separate
proposals. Does not standardise a source-file format, an editor, or a package layout.

⚠ This standard does not claim the dialect is the only readable representation of Script, nor that BASIC is
the best available syntax. It claims that the correspondence is exact, that both directions are implementable,
and that the reverse direction is the one currently missing.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY" are as described in RFC 2119.

### 1. The correspondence

Every infix language is compiled to a stack machine. An expression parser converts infix to postfix, and the
postfix form is a sequence of pushes and operators applied to a stack. Script *is* that stack machine, with
the front end absent: it has the operators, the stack, and no parser.

The correspondence therefore requires no invention. A conforming implementation MUST NOT introduce runtime
machinery that Script does not have — no call stack, no heap, no return addresses, no runtime types. Every
construct in the dialect MUST either emit opcodes directly or be resolved entirely at compile time.

### 2. The dialect

A conforming dialect MUST provide, and its decompiler MUST recognise:

- **Assignment** — `LET v = expr`, with `LET` optional. Infix expressions with conventional precedence.
- **Conditionals** — `IF cond THEN … ELSE …` on one line, or `IF cond THEN` opening a block closed by
  `END IF` (or `ENDIF`). The spellings MUST compile to identical bytes. ⚠ The block form is not sugar: a
  line-scoped arm ends where its line ends, so a loop cannot live in one.
- **Verification** — `VERIFY expr`, emitting `OP_VERIFY`; the covenant's refusals are statements, not
  side effects.
- **Counted loops** — `FOR i = a TO b [STEP s] … NEXT i`, unrolled at compile time (§4.2).
- **Fixed-width state** — `DIM name%width` for numeric fields, `DIM name$width` for opaque bytes, with
  `1 ≤ width ≤ 75` (§4.3). ⚠ `DIM` belongs to a distinct compilation mode, not to a free-standing program:
  a layout is meaningless without the field offset and the peel and rebuild generated around it, and a
  conforming compiler MUST refuse it outside that mode rather than emit a bare push.
- **Two-value results** — `l, r = SPLIT(x, n)`, since `OP_SPLIT` returns two values and no BASIC needed to.
- **Line numbers**, optional in source and emitted by the decompiler, and **`&H` hexadecimal literals**.

⚠ Implementations MAY extend the dialect, but a decompiler MUST NOT emit a construct its own compiler cannot
parse. A reader that prints a dialect the writer rejects is two tools, not one.

### 3. Opcode correspondence

The machine's own words are its opcodes, exactly as every BASIC had words for the machine beneath it. The
reference implementation maps **35** of them; a conforming implementation MUST use these names for these
opcodes, so that a listing produced by one tool is parsed by another.

| operators | | comparisons (numeric) | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+` | `OP_ADD` 0x93 | `=` | `OP_NUMEQUAL` 0x9c |
| `-` | `OP_SUB` 0x94 | `<>` | `OP_NUMNOTEQUAL` 0x9e |
| `*` | `OP_MUL` 0x95 | `<` | `OP_LESSTHAN` 0x9f |
| `/` | `OP_DIV` 0x96 | `>` | `OP_GREATERTHAN` 0xa0 |

| `OR` | `OP_BOOLOR` 0x9b | `>=` | `OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL` 0xa2 |

| `ISTRUE` | `OP_0NOTEQUAL` 0x92 | `NUM2BIN` | `OP_NUM2BIN` 0x80 |
| `BIN2NUM` | `OP_BIN2NUM` 0x81 | `MOD` | `OP_MOD` 0x97 |
| `INVERT` | `OP_INVERT` 0x83 | `BITAND` | `OP_AND` 0x84 |

| `HASH160` | `OP_HASH160` 0xa9 | `BITXOR` | `OP_XOR` 0x86 |
| `SHA256` | `OP_SHA256` 0xa8 | `LSHIFT` | `OP_LSHIFT` 0x98 |
| `SHA1` | `OP_SHA1` 0xa7 | `RSHIFT` | `OP_RSHIFT` 0x99 |
| `RIPEMD160` | `OP_RIPEMD160` 0xa6 | `SAMEBYTES` | `OP_EQUAL` 0x87 |
| | | `CHECKSIG` | `OP_CHECKSIG` 0xac |

⚠⚠ **`=` and `SAMEBYTES` MUST NOT be given one name.** `=` is `OP_NUMEQUAL` and compares numbers;
`SAMEBYTES` is `OP_EQUAL` and compares byte strings. `0`, `-0` and a zero padded to four bytes are one number
and three different byte strings. Merging them erases a distinction that decides whether a covenant accepts a
spend.

⚠ `BITAND`, `BITOR` and `BITXOR` are named apart from `AND` and `OR` for the same reason: `OP_BOOLAND` asks
whether both operands are non-zero, and is not a bitwise operation.

### 4. What a covenant compiler must do that no BASIC had to

#### 4.1 Balance the branches

Both arms of an `OP_IF` MUST leave the stack in the same shape. A conforming compiler MUST verify this and
MUST refuse to emit otherwise. Hand-written Script gets this wrong silently, and the resulting failure
surfaces far from its cause — typically where a later `OP_SPLIT` complains about a size.

#### 4.2 Unroll the loops

Script has no backward jump, so there is nothing for a loop to compile to. `FOR … NEXT` MUST be unrolled at
compile time, with the bounds known statically, and a conforming compiler MUST bound the expansion and fail
rather than emit an unbounded one. Iteration in a script is spatial; iteration over time is a chain of
spends, and is outside this standard.

⚠ A decompiler cannot recover a `FOR` that was unrolled — the loop is not in the script. It MUST render the
unrolled body rather than infer a loop that may not have existed.

#### 4.3 Make the widths the layout

`DIM` MUST declare a field's byte width, and that width MUST be the width the script carries. A conforming
compiler generates both the reading of the state out of the script and its rebuilding, from the declaration
alone.

Widths MUST be whole bytes in the range **1 to 75**, and a compiler MUST refuse anything outside it. Above 75
a data push requires `OP_PUSHDATA1` and a separate length byte, which shifts every offset after that field and
breaks the property that the push opcode equals the width — the invariant a third-party reader depends on (see
BRC-X).

⚠ The rebuild MUST gather fields **by name**, not by position: a compiler that reuses or coalesces slots
will not leave them in declaration order, and a positional rebuild then assembles a valid-looking script with
its state transposed.

#### 4.4 Refuse rather than degrade

Where a construct cannot be expressed in opcodes, a conforming compiler MUST fail with a statement of why,
and MUST NOT emit an approximation.

Exponentiation is the worked case. `^` is resolved at compile time in arbitrary-precision integers, is
right-associative, and MUST reject a negative exponent and an exponent large enough to exceed what a script
number can carry. If either operand is unknown until the script runs, the compiler MUST fail — Script has no
power opcode, so there is nothing to emit. The idiom that replaces it is an unrolled loop whose counter
supplies the exponent, which is also how the dialect supplies an array:

```basic
FOR k = 0 TO 23 : IF slot = k THEN bit = 2 ^ k : NEXT k
```

Twenty-four comparisons, each with its constant already folded. **Script has no arrays; that is one.**

### 5. Reading a script back

A conforming decompiler MUST operate on a script's parsed chunks, MUST NOT require the script to have been
produced by the compiler, and MUST NOT modify the script in any way. Names are annotation supplied by the
caller — the bytes remain the source of truth.

It MUST accept a declaration of what the stack already holds when the script begins, since a locking script
is entered with the unlocking script's pushes already present, and without them a reader cannot know what it
is looking at. Where no names are supplied it MUST still produce a correct listing with generated names.

It MUST report, rather than guess, when it can no longer track the stack — a script that reads below the
bottom of the stack as the reader models it indicates either a malformed script or a wrong stack declaration,
and both are results worth having.

### 6. Two examples, in both languages

**One expression.** The stack already holds `v`, `force`, `mass` and `nv`.

```basic
10 nv = v + force / mass
```

```
010379  push 3, OP_PICK      v
010379  push 3, OP_PICK      force
010379  push 3, OP_PICK      mass
96      OP_DIV               force / mass
93      OP_ADD               v + that
77      OP_NIP               discard the slot nv used to occupy
```

12 bytes, 9 opcodes. Infix became postfix, which is the whole of the correspondence in §1: the parser is the
only thing Script was missing, and precedence decided the order of two opcodes.

**A balanced conditional.** The stack holds `grip`, `demand` and `force`.

```basic
10 force = 0
20 IF demand > grip THEN force = grip ELSE force = demand
```

```
00 77                     OP_0, OP_NIP            force = 0
010179 010379 a0          pick demand, pick grip, OP_GREATERTHAN
63                        OP_IF
  010279 0079 6b 75 6c      pick grip   → assign force
67                        OP_ELSE
  010179 0079 6b 75 6c      pick demand → assign force
68                        OP_ENDIF
77                        OP_NIP
```

29 bytes, 25 opcodes. ★ Note that **both arms emit the same seven-opcode shape**, differing only in which
value they pick. That is §4.1 in the output: the compiler takes the union of what either arm assigns and makes
both arms produce all of it, so the stack leaves the conditional identical either way. Hand-written Script is
where this goes wrong, and it goes wrong silently — a mismatch surfaces much later, wherever the first opcode
happens to read a slot that has moved.

**Indexing without arrays.** Noughts and crosses packs nine squares base 3 into two bytes — 0 empty, 1 for
X, 2 for O — so a square is read by arithmetic rather than by lookup:

```basic
DIM board%2      REM  nine squares packed base 3
DIM turn%1       REM  whose move it is — 1 or 2

place = 0
IF move = 0 THEN place = 1
IF move = 1 THEN place = 3
IF move = 2 THEN place = 9
REM  … through to 6561
VERIFY place > 0                      REM  ★ the bounds check is free

VERIFY MOD(board / place, 3) = 0      REM  the square is empty
p = turn
board = board + p * place             REM  playing a move is an addition
turn = 3 - p                          REM  and the turn flips by arithmetic
```

★ Two properties fall out of the encoding rather than being enforced by extra code. **A move outside 0…8
selects no constant, so `place` stays 0 and the bounds check costs nothing** — and because the turn is read
from state and written back as `3 - p`, no party can play twice or play as the other. A base-4 packing of the
same game is 105 bytes smaller, and gives up exactly this: a shift accepts an out-of-range index that a table
of comparisons refuses.

**Bounded and unbounded, from one source.** Rule 110 is the same program with one number changed:

```basic
DIM cells%4      REM  31 cells, one bit each, wrapped into a ring
DIM gen%2

FOR g = 1 TO <generations>
  new = 0
  FOR i = 0 TO 30
    l = MOD(cells / 2 ^ MOD(i + 1, 31), 2)
    c = MOD(cells / 2 ^ i, 2)
    r = MOD(cells / 2 ^ MOD(i + 30, 31), 2)
    new = new + ((c OR r) AND NOT(l AND c AND r)) * 2 ^ i
  NEXT i
  cells = new
  gen = gen + 1
NEXT g
```

`<generations>` = 1 gives one generation per transaction; = 8 gives eight generations in one script, at 19,655
bytes. Both were run and **arrive at the same state**. Every `2 ^ …` is folded at compile time because `i` is a
loop counter, so the divisors are constants and there is no runtime index at all — which is why this program,
alone among the four, needs neither a comparison table nor a shift. The eight-row rule table collapses to one
line of boolean algebra.

### 7. The round trip

A program produced by the decompiler MUST recompile. The recompiled script MUST be semantically identical to
the original; it SHOULD be byte-identical where the source construct survives in the script.

★ **A disagreement between the two representations is the deliverable, not a defect in the tools.** The
static model held by the compiler is a stated hypothesis about a stack; the script interpreter is the
referee. Where they differ, the difference is reported at the instruction that causes it rather than at the
opcode that eventually fails — which is the shortest available path from a symptom to a cause.

### 8. Conformance

1. Every name in §3 maps to its stated opcode, and `=` / `SAMEBYTES` are distinct. (§3)
2. Both spellings of a conditional compile to identical bytes. (§2)
3. Branch arms are checked for equal stack shape, and emission is refused otherwise. (§4.1)
4. `FOR` is unrolled with static bounds and a bounded expansion. (§4.2)
5. `DIM` widths are the widths carried, and the rebuild gathers by name. (§4.3)
6. A construct with no opcode is refused with a reason, never approximated. (§4.4)
7. The decompiler reads scripts it did not produce, modifies nothing, and reports loss of stack tracking
   rather than guessing. (§5)
8. Decompiled programs recompile to semantically identical scripts. (§7)

⚠ Item 8 is the one that is worth measuring rather than asserting, and the measurement MUST include the
number that recompile **byte-identically** — an implementation that recompiles to equivalent-but-different
scripts every time has a defect its own test suite will not report.

## Implementations

There are two copies of the reference implementation, and they exist for different reasons.

**To use it — the workbench:** https://grafverse.com/basic.html · compiles, decompiles, and reads a script
straight off the chain. It requires no installation and no build; the page carries a prebuilt bundle.

**To verify it, or to have it outlast this document — the archive.** Published on chain so that a standard's
reference implementation is a payload rather than a link:

```
payload   8e0a79e00ef3c38cf3c4fa33c7d8032cc5def3853c0e798730c48217f00a369a
archive   f308f18b952360b46d207beb8539bb202d704ab80e23c39425c76f024d908175   200,280 B · 15 files
```

The archive was recovered from that transaction, unpacked, and its test suites run: **42/42, 18/18 and 10/10**.
Verification is therefore reproducible from the txid alone rather than from a repository that may move.

★ The compiler and the decompiler import only an opcode-number table and a type that erases at runtime.
**An implementation in another language needs a list of opcode numbers and nothing more.** Cryptography
appears in the reference implementation solely where covenants authorise spends, which is not part of this
standard.

**The round trip, measured:** of 15 decompiled programs, **15 recompile and 9 are byte-identical**. The six
that differ contain unrolled loops, which cannot read back as loops (§4.2). A hand-written covenant of 1,672
bytes and 1,108 opcodes renders as a listing; a 1,428-byte covenant renders as 216 lines.

**Four covenants are included as tests**, each answering the absence of arrays differently, and all deployed
or interpreter-validated as real spends:

| | lock | opcodes | approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| Noughts and crosses, base 3 | 1,330 B | 957 | nine comparisons; a board packed base 3, so reading a square is arithmetic |
| the same game, base 4 | 1,226 B | | one extra byte of state buys 105 fewer bytes of program — 1.16× |
| Space Invaders, 55 aliens | 1,082 B | 743 | `2 ^ k` folded inside an unrolled loop *is* the array |
| Rule 110, 31 cells | 2,974 B | | no runtime index at all |

⚠ The base-4 result is not free: a shift does not supply the bounds check that a comparison did.

### Turing completeness, stated exactly

Rule 110 is Turing complete by Cook's proof. Compiled from this dialect it runs two ways, and both were
measured: **eight generations unrolled into one script** (19,655 bytes), and **eight generations as eight
chained spends** (23,792 bytes across eight scripts). Both arrive at exactly the same state.

The distinction that matters is between a script and a chain of them, and it is usually stated backwards.

**A single script is total: it provably halts.** Its step count is bounded before it runs.

⚠ But it is not true that a script cannot iterate. **A script iterates perfectly well** — Rule 110 advances
thirty-one cells every generation, unrolled, inside one script. What a script cannot do is run an *unknown*
number of times, and that is the only thing the chain is needed for. **The chain does not supply the looping.
It supplies the not knowing when to stop.**

A chain of covenant spends is unbounded in that count, so Rule 110 compiled from this dialect and advanced by
such a chain is a universal computation: **covenant-chained Script is Turing complete** in the same qualified
sense that any physical computer is.

⚠ **The qualification is the tape, not the loop.** Universality requires unbounded working storage; the
deployed instance carries 31 cells and is therefore a finite automaton, however long it runs. The construction
generalises — a covenant may carry more state at each spend than it carried at the last, and nothing in the
transaction model bounds that — but a conforming implementation SHOULD state which of the two it has built,
because a fixed-width state machine and an unbounded one are different claims.

★ **And the absence of an in-script loop follows from what the machine is for, rather than from a shortfall in
its language.** Bitcoin is a timestamp server: its function is to order events in time. A program that never
finishes produces no event to order — the transaction carrying its result is never built, and a script that
failed to terminate would never be validated into a block. A timestamp server has no unbounded time to offer a
computation that will never finish.

So the model does not exclude unbounded computation. It requires unbounded computation to be presented **one
halting step at a time**, which is the condition under which each step can be validated by everybody and paid
for by somebody. What reads as a missing language feature is the same property that makes the result
verifiable.

⇒ Where an iteration is placed is then an **economic** question rather than a question of capability, and the
answer differs per program. Rule 110's body dominates its frame 4.3 to 1, so unrolling eight generations into
one script buys only 1.21×. A covenant whose frame dominates its body by 13 to 1 gained roughly tenfold from
the same change.
