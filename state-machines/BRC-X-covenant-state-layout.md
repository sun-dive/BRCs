# BRC-X: Fixed-Width State in a Covenant's Own Locking Script

sun-dive (https://github.com/sun-dive)

## Abstract

This standard defines how a covenant carries mutable state inside its own locking script, as a run of
fixed-width data pushes, such that the state can be located, read and rewritten at constant byte
offsets — by the covenant itself, and by any third party holding only the script.

The layout is **self-describing**: for every field, the single-byte push opcode that precedes the data
is numerically equal to the field's width. A reader that knows nothing but the list of widths can walk
the state, and a reader that knows nothing at all can still verify that each push agrees with the next
offset it implies.

The convention is already carried by three distinct covenant families on mainnet, and read across the
boundary by a fourth covenant that shares no code with them.

## Motivation

A covenant that changes state must do two things on every spend: read its current state, and prove that
its successor's state is the correct one. Bitcoin Script offers exactly one honest source for the
former — the `scriptCode` field of the sighash preimage, which is the only copy of the script a miner
has verified. So the state has to live in the script, and the script has to be able to cut it out again.

`OP_SPLIT` cuts at a *constant* offset. It cannot search, and it cannot follow a length prefix computed
at runtime without spending opcodes to do so. That single fact forces the shape of any workable answer:
**fixed widths, in a fixed order, at a known starting offset.** Every covenant that carries state
arrives at this independently.

The cost of arriving at it independently is that nothing can read anything else. Two covenants written
by two teams cannot inspect one another's state, tooling cannot render either of them, and an indexer
must special-case each one. That is the gap this document closes, and the gap is not hypothetical:

- A **fuel depot** covenant needs to recognise a **racing car** covenant well enough to refuel it —
  which means locating the car's owner field inside the car's script, with no shared code path and no
  ability to run the car's own logic. It walks the layout defined here and validates every push opcode
  against the width the layout declares. If any disagrees, it refuses. That is a third-party read of
  another covenant's state, in production, and it is only possible because the layout is a convention
  rather than a private detail.

- A **reader tool** can render any conforming covenant's state without being told anything about the
  covenant, because the field boundaries are recoverable from the script.

### Scope

This standard is deliberately narrow. It defines **where the state sits and how it is encoded** — and
nothing else. It does not define what the fields mean, how the preimage is authorised, what the
successor state must be, or what the covenant's output value may become. Those differ between every
covenant that has ever needed them, and a standard that guessed at them would be wrong for all of them.

What it buys is that any covenant, any wallet, any indexer and any tool can find and read the state of
any conforming script without being told anything else about it.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### 1. Terminology

- **Field** — one unit of covenant state: a single data push of a fixed byte width.
- **PRE** — every byte of the script before the first field's *data*, including the first field's own
  push opcode.
- **SUF** — every byte of the script after the last field's data. In practice this is the covenant's
  code, and it is never inspected by this standard.
- **scriptCode field** — the BIP143 preimage member holding `varint(scriptLen) ‖ script`.

### 2. Script layout

A conforming locking script MUST begin with:

```
PRE ‖ ⟨w₀⟩ f₀ ‖ ⟨w₁⟩ f₁ ‖ … ‖ ⟨wₙ⟩ fₙ ‖ SUF
```

where `⟨wᵢ⟩` is a single byte whose value is `wᵢ`, and `fᵢ` is exactly `wᵢ` bytes of data. The fields
MUST be contiguous: no opcode may appear between the end of `fᵢ` and the push opcode of `fᵢ₊₁`.

### 3. Field width

`1 ≤ wᵢ ≤ 75`.

⚠ 75 is not a stylistic limit. At 76 a data push is encoded as `OP_PUSHDATA1` followed by a separate
length byte, the push opcode ceases to equal the width, every offset after that field shifts by one,
and the self-describing property in §5 is lost. Implementations MUST reject a declared width outside
this range rather than emit a script whose offsets silently disagree with its declaration.

A field wider than 75 bytes MUST be expressed as two or more adjacent fields.

### 4. Field encoding

Two kinds of field are defined:

- **Numeric.** The value is encoded in exactly `wᵢ` bytes, little-endian, sign-magnitude — the encoding
  produced by `OP_NUM2BIN` and consumed by `OP_BIN2NUM`. The top bit of the most significant byte is
  the sign. The representable magnitude is therefore `±(2^(8wᵢ − 1) − 1)`.

- **Opaque.** The value is `wᵢ` raw bytes and MUST NOT be converted to or from a script number.

⚠ The distinction is load-bearing and is not decoration. `OP_BIN2NUM` applied to a 20-byte hash is
meaningless, and `OP_NUM2BIN` will not reliably put it back. Separately, a byte string whose only set
bit is the sign bit of its most significant byte reads as *negative zero* — numerically indistinguishable
from empty. Implementations comparing opaque fields MUST use a byte comparison (`OP_EQUAL`), never a
numeric one (`OP_NUMEQUAL`).

An implementation MUST record, per field, which kind it is. This standard does not define how that
record is transmitted; see §9.

### 5. The self-describing invariant

For every field, the byte immediately preceding its data MUST be numerically equal to that field's
width.

This follows automatically from §2 and §3 when the script is built with minimal data pushes, and it is
the property that makes the layout walkable. A reader holding the ordered list of widths can traverse
the state and verify at every step that the script agrees with the list. A reader holding no list at
all can still recover the field boundaries by treating each byte at a field position as a length.

Verification, given widths `w₀ … wₙ` and the byte offset `h` at which the first field's push opcode
sits, is:

```
off ← h
for i in 0 … n:
    assert script[off] = wᵢ          # the push opcode is the width
    off ← off + 1 + wᵢ
```

A covenant that reads another covenant's state MUST perform this check and MUST refuse the spend if any
push opcode disagrees. Skipping it permits a counterfeit script whose fields sit at the expected
offsets but describe a different layout.

### 6. The header

Fields SHOULD be preceded by a three-push header identifying the protocol and the record:

```
01 50    push "P"           protocol prefix
01 vv    push <version>     header format version, currently 0x01
01 rr    push <record>      record type — what the fields mean
```

This occupies six bytes, so with the first field's push opcode `PRE` is seven bytes plus the
`scriptCode` field's own varint. The header is what allows a reader to recognise a conforming script
before it has any idea which covenant produced it, and the record type is what tells it which field
list to use.

### 7. Deriving the field offset

The offset at which the covenant splits its own `scriptCode` is:

```
fieldOffset = varIntSize(scriptLen) + headerBytes + 1
```

⚠⚠ **This is circular, and the circularity is the most common way to get this wrong.** BIP143 prefixes
the `scriptCode` with its own length as a varint, so `fieldOffset` depends on the finished script's
length — and the finished script contains `fieldOffset` as a literal. A one-byte difference in the
varint moves every field.

Implementations MUST resolve it by construction, not by assumption:

1. Build the script once with any placeholder offset.
2. Measure the resulting length.
3. Compute `varIntSize` from that length.
4. Build again with the real offset.

A second pass is sufficient because the offset is a small literal whose own encoded size does not vary
across the values it can take in step 4. Implementations SHOULD assert that the second build's length
yields the same `varIntSize` as the first.

### 8. Reading and writing

**Reading**, with the `scriptCode` field on the stack:

```
push fieldOffset · OP_SPLIT              → PRE, rest
for i in 0 … n:
    if i > 0:  OP_1 · OP_SPLIT · OP_NIP  → discard the push opcode
    push wᵢ · OP_SPLIT                   → fᵢ, rest
                                          rest is SUF after the last field
```

Numeric fields are converted with `OP_BIN2NUM` at this point. Opaque fields are not converted at all.

**Writing** is the inverse, and MUST reproduce the script exactly:

```
numeric fields: push wᵢ · OP_NUM2BIN
PRE ‖ f₀                                 (f₀'s push opcode is already inside PRE)
for i in 1 … n:  ‖ ⟨wᵢ⟩ ‖ fᵢ
‖ SUF
```

⚠ `OP_NUM2BIN` fails if the value does not fit `wᵢ`. That is the desired behaviour: the alternative,
truncating to fit, yields a well-formed script carrying a different number. Implementations that
construct state off-chain MUST range-check before encoding rather than truncate.

The covenant then binds the rebuilt script by comparing `HASH256(value ‖ rebuilt scriptCode field ‖ any
further outputs)` against the `hashOutputs` member of its own verified preimage. The mechanism by which
the preimage is verified is out of scope; `OP_PUSH_TX` is one.

★ Note that the rebuilt script is assembled from `PRE` and `SUF` taken out of the preimage. A conforming
covenant therefore recreates itself **without containing a copy of itself**.

### 9. Record types

The record type byte in §6 selects the field list — the ordered widths and their kinds. This standard
reserves no values and defines no registry; a record type is meaningful only alongside a published
description of its fields, which SHOULD accompany the covenant that uses it.

Values in use by the reference implementations at the time of writing:

```
0x06   live counter
0x07   battery
0x08   racing shell
```

### 10. A worked example, in full

Two fields — `phase` at one byte and `n` at four — under the header in §6, with `n` incremented. The
opcodes below are not illustrative: they were emitted by a conforming implementation and run through a
script interpreter, which rebuilt the script byte for byte.

```
scriptCode before   fd0003 015001010106 01 02 04 29000000 51529387
scriptCode after    fd0003 015001010106 01 02 04 2a000000 51529387
                    └varint┘└─ header ─┘ ▲  ▲  ▲  ▲          └─ SUF ─┘
                                         │  │  │  └ n = 41 → 42, four bytes little-endian
                                         │  │  └─ w₁ = 4, and this byte IS the push opcode
                                         │  └─ phase = 2
                                         └─ w₀ = 1  (this byte is the last byte of PRE)

fieldOffset = varIntSize(3) + headerBytes(6) + 1 = 10
```

**Reading** — 18 bytes:

```
01 0a    push 10          the field offset from §7
7f       OP_SPLIT         → PRE, rest
01 01    push 1           w₀
7f       OP_SPLIT         → phase, rest
7c 81 7c SWAP BIN2NUM SWAP  phase is numeric, so convert it in place
51       OP_1
7f       OP_SPLIT
77       OP_NIP           discard the push opcode in front of field 1
01 04    push 4           w₁
7f       OP_SPLIT         → n, rest — and rest is now SUF
7c 81 7c SWAP BIN2NUM SWAP

010a7f01017f7c817c517f7701047f7c817c
```

**Writing** — 23 bytes:

```
01 04 80 push 4, OP_NUM2BIN     n back to four bytes
6b       OP_TOALTSTACK
01 02 7a push 2, OP_ROLL        bring PRE up
01 02 7a push 2, OP_ROLL        bring phase up
01 01 80 push 1, OP_NUM2BIN
7e       OP_CAT                 PRE ‖ phase
01 04    push 4                 ★ the push opcode for field 1 — written as a LITERAL, and it is the
7e       OP_CAT                   same byte as the width. That single line is §5.
6c 7e    FROMALTSTACK, OP_CAT   ‖ n
01 01 7a push 1, OP_ROLL        SUF
7e       OP_CAT                 ‖ SUF

0104806b01027a01027a0101807e01047e6c7e01017a7e
```

⚠ Note what is NOT here: no copy of the script, and no length that had to be computed while running.
The covenant reassembles itself from two pieces it cut out of its own `scriptCode`, and every number it
pushes is a constant known when the script was written.

### 11. Conformance

An implementation conforms if:

1. Every field's push opcode equals its width, and every width is in `1 … 75`. (§2, §3, §5)
2. Numeric fields round-trip through `OP_NUM2BIN` / `OP_BIN2NUM` at their declared width, and opaque
   fields are never converted. (§4)
3. Opaque fields are compared as bytes, never as numbers. (§4)
4. `fieldOffset` is derived by building, measuring and rebuilding — not assumed. (§7)
5. Rebuilding an unmodified state reproduces the original script **byte for byte**. (§8)
6. A reader that walks another script's fields verifies every push opcode against the expected width
   and refuses on any disagreement. (§5)

⚠ Item 5 is the cheapest and most valuable test to write first. A covenant that cannot read its own
state and write it back unchanged has nothing worth debugging on top of it, and the failure is silent
until an output comparison fails hundreds of opcodes later.

## Implementations

All of the following are deployed on BSV mainnet.

**Covenants carrying state in this layout**

| covenant | fields | state bytes | lock |
|---|---|---|---|
| live counter | 2 | 24 | 674 B |
| battery | 9 | 39 | 1,428 B |
| racing shell | 13 | 98 | 1,672 B |

The header and the invariant are identical across all three. Their opening bytes:

```
live counter   01 50 01 01 01 06 04 07 00 00 00 14 …
battery        01 50 01 01 01 07 05 00 fe ff ff 81 …
racing shell   01 50 01 01 01 08 01 00 14 00 00 00 …
               └── "P" ──┘ └ver┘ └rec┘ └w₀┘└─ f₀ …
```

Each was walked programmatically for this document, and in every case every push opcode equalled its
declared width across the full field list.

**A covenant reading another covenant's state**

The fuel depot carries no state of its own — its script is constant, which is what lets a car name it
by a single hash. It nevertheless locates the owner field inside a *racing shell's* script by walking
the layout in §5 and validating each push opcode against the expected width, refusing the spend on any
disagreement. This is the interoperability case, in production, between two covenants with no shared
execution path.

**Tooling**

A browser workbench compiles this layout from a source declaration and reads it back out of an
arbitrary locking script, rendering the covenant as a program. It reads all four covenants above.

- Workbench: https://grafverse.com/basic.html
- Source, tests and the covenants: https://github.com/sun-dive/grafverse — `mint/src/`

The reference implementation and its test suite were written by Claude (Opus 5).

autonomous agent carries its state as record type `0x07` under this layout.
